# COMP 1004 COURSEWORK: Time Management Game
## PLATFORM & OPENING GAME
I Programmed this testing on edge, so I'd reccomend playing via edge or another chromium based browser.
While I have done a quick preliminary test on firefox, I cannot guarantee the project will run perfectly (especially because a bug in firefox forced me to swap to developing on edge in the first place).

The game should run fine whether opened from the HTML file, or if hosted via something like XAMPP
##HOW TO PLAY

At every point in the game, you will be given text giving the contxt of your situation, and you are presented with choices of what to do, each of these choices will increase and decrease different stats (for example, eating increasing your food stat).
